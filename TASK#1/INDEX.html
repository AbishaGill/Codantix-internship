    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Abisha Gill, a 19-year-old undergraduate student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) at Mohammad Ali Jinnah University, where I am enrolled in the 3rd semester. Alongside my studies, I have recently begun an internship in frontend development, where I am gaining practical experience with modern web technologies such as Tailwind CSS, React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This role is helping me enhance my technical expertise and establish a solid foundation for a successful career in software development.</p>
